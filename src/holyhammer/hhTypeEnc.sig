     are HOL formulas: universal quantifiers are boolSyntax.mk_forall,
     equality is boolSyntax.mk_eq, and the first-order equality proxy is an
     application headed by a constant or variable named fequal or pxy.eq.
     Free variables are treated as implicitly universal.  It returns the
     distinct types which require mono_guards?? encoding: bool and the
     types of possibly universal naked variables in positive equality or
     fequal occurrences, except types proved infinite by surely_infinite.

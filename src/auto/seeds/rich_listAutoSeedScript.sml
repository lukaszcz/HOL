   ambiently but leaves the fold over the result alone, so a goal that
   folds across an append stops one rewrite short. *)

(* src/HOL/List.thy:1824 @ f7e02b7e.  [nth_append_length] is simp there:
   indexing an append at exactly the left length reaches the right
   list's head.  HOL4 states it on a non-empty right list and declares
   it nowhere.  Its [_plus] companion has no HOL4 counterpart, and the
   conditional halves [nth_append_left] and [_right] are simp in
   neither system; see the rest of the indexing family in
   listAutoSeed. *)

(* src/HOL/List.thy:1807 @ f7e02b7e.  [nth_Cons_pos] is simp there and
   declared to no simpset here.  It is the constructor the indexing
   family in listAutoSeed leaves out -- a cons against an index known
   only to be non-zero, which is what a case split on the index leaves
   standing on the branch it does not settle.  HOL4 states it as
   EL_CONS, spelling the index below as [PRE n] where a translated goal
   spells it [n - 1]; the seeded step between the two spellings is what
   lets the rule meet such a goal at all. *)

(* src/HOL/List.thy @ f7e02b7e.  [hd_replicate] is simp there and HOL4
   states it nowhere: the walk down a replicate reads its head off the
   count, and a source result about [takeWhile] or [dropWhile] of a
   replicate reaches its head through the [xs = [] \/ ~P (hd xs)] side
   of the walk's own characterisation.  The count is a variable, so no
   REPLICATE clause reduces and the head stays stuck. *)
Theorem HD_REPLICATE_AUTO[simp]:

(* src/HOL/List.thy @ f7e02b7e.  [hd_in_set] is simp there: the head
   of a non-empty list is one of its elements.  HOL4 states the same
   fact as [HEAD_MEM] and declares it to no simpset, so a premise
   quantified over the elements of a list stops short of its head --
   the simplifier's condition solver has no way to discharge
   [MEM (HD l) l], and every rule whose side condition asks for it
   fails to fire. *)

(* src/HOL/List.thy @ f7e02b7e.  [take_append] is simp there and

   listAutoSeed, which states them. *)

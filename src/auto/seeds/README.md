# Automation seeds

This directory contains optional automation rules built after `src/boss`.
Each source theory has its own `*AutoSeed` theory; `autoSeed` imports all of
them.  A child theory inherits the rules of every seed theory in its
ancestry.  Loading a seed does not change HOL4's default simplifier rules.

`seedAudit` checks every rule classified as safe by proving the reverse
direction required to show that applying the rule cannot lose solutions.
The named `algebra_simps` and `field_simps` collections are exposed by
`seedCollections` as optional simplifier fragments (`simpLib.ssfrag`
values).

Declarations are grouped by the job they do, rather than by the theory
in which their theorem was first proved:

- Structural normalization uses `[simp]`, `[iff]`, or the subject-last
  `[simp_bottom_up]` and `[iff_bottom_up]` views. These read
  constructors, membership, list operators and quantifier bodies into
  forms other rules can match. The bottom-up views are for rules such
  as option non-`NONE` and miniscoping laws whose subject must be
  simplified first.
- Contextual simplification uses `[simp]` rules with premises and the
  explicit `algebra_simps` and `field_simps` collections. Assumptions
  discharge rewrite conditions; algebraic expansion and field rewrites
  remain opt-in where they may enlarge terms.
- Safe decomposition uses `[sintro]`, `[selim]` and `[sdest]` to expose
  all branches or premises without committing to a witness or losing
  solutions. `seedAudit` checks the declared safe direction.
- Search choices use `[intro]`, `[elim]` and `[dest]` to offer witnesses,
  case splits and consequences only to unsafe search. Universe
  membership and transitive-closure steps should not fire in every
  safe pass.
- Bridges use dual declarations such as `[simp, dest]` for order
  components and `[simp, intro]` for well-founded inverse images. They
  make a fact available both at a rewrite side condition and at a
  search rule premise, where rewriting the goal alone cannot reach it.

`[iff]` also supplies classical views of an equivalence. The rule's
actual safe or unsafe claset role is determined by the derived direction,
not by the fact that it is an equivalence. Split declarations are kept
for constructor-sensitive branching rather than treated as rewrite laws.

`INJ_DEF_AUTO` unfolds an `INJ` head in the simplifier to expose its
defining obligations. A client may still supply an unsafe rule with an
`INJ` premise: clasimp keeps the original rule and derives a certified
view whose premise has the seed's normal form. Conjunctive premises are
curried so the rule can use separately simplified assumptions. The
seed selftest exercises this interaction with an independently defined
client predicate. Safe tagged rules and persistent rules still need a
separate transport audit. Safe-rule inversion does not establish rewrite
termination or search completeness; those properties need separate
normalization and consumer tests.

For the complete seeded state, make `autoSeed` an ancestor of a theory (or
`open autoSeedTheory` in an ML consumer).  A smaller consumer can depend on
one per-theory seed such as `listAutoSeed` instead.  The numeric collections
remain explicit:

```sml
SIMP_TAC (srw_ss() ++ seedCollections.algebra_ss ()) []
SIMP_TAC (srw_ss() ++ seedCollections.field_ss ()) []
```

Use `remove_algebra_simps` and `remove_field_simps` with persistent theorem
names when a descendant theory needs to retract an inherited member.

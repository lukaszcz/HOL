   Examples: classical proof search (classicalLib)

   The tactics of src/auto/classical are the HOL4 analogues of
   Isabelle/HOL's classical reasoner:

     FAST_TAC        depth-first search           (Isabelle: fast)
     BEST_TAC        best-first search            (Isabelle: best)
     SLOW_TAC        FAST with more backtracking  (Isabelle: slow)
     SLOW_BEST_TAC   BEST with more backtracking  (Isabelle: slow_best)
     FIRST_BEST_TAC  BEST expanding any subgoal   (Isabelle: first_best)
     ASTAR_TAC       A*-weighted best-first       (Isabelle: astar)
     SLOW_ASTAR_TAC  ASTAR with more backtracking (Isabelle: slow_astar)
     DEEPEN_TAC      iterative deepening          (Isabelle: deepen)
     SAFE_TAC        all safe steps, may split    (Isabelle: safe)
     CLARIFY_TAC     safe steps, no splitting     (Isabelle: clarify)

   All of them search with the ambient claset (see
   clasetExamplesScript for how rules are declared) and take a
   [thm list]: plain theorems are inserted as facts, marker-wrapped
   theorems (Intro, Dest, ...) become invocation-scoped rules.

   The step tactics SAFE_STEP_TAC, CLARIFY_STEP_TAC, STEP_TAC,
   SLOW_STEP_TAC and INST_STEP_TAC expose single search steps for
   building custom loops and are not shown here.  Each tactic also has
   a CS_ variant taking an explicit claset instead of the ambient one.

   FAST_TAC on propositional logic.  These need genuinely classical

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   FAST_TAC on quantified goals.  Unsafe quantifier rules guess their
   instantiations by unification during the search; the found proof is
   replayed through the kernel, so nothing rests on the search itself.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

   Invocation-scoped rules.  [sym R] has no rules in the ambient
   claset, so the definition's two directions are passed as markers:
   Dest turns a [sym R] assumption into its pointwise content, Intro
   proves a [sym R] goal from it.

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SAFE_TAC and CLARIFY_TAC: the non-search fragment.

   SAFE_TAC performs every safe step it can -- stripping, splitting
   conjunctions and case-splitting assumptions -- and never needs to
   backtrack, so it is a sound opening move for manual proofs.  It can
   close purely "safe" goals outright:
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

Theorem safe_closes_case_analysis:
  p \/ q ==> (p ==> r) ==> (q ==> r) ==> r
Proof
  SAFE_TAC []
QED

(* Where an unsafe step (here: a witness for the existential) is
   required, SAFE_TAC stops and leaves the decomposed goal for the
   user. *)

  P a ==> ?x:'a. P x

(* CLARIFY_TAC performs only safe steps that do not split the goal --
   useful when a case split would obscure what remains to be proved. *)

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The search variants.  On small goals they are interchangeable; they
   differ in how they explore the search space, and each dominates on
   some class of larger problems:

     BEST_TAC     expands the smallest open goal first, so it recovers
                  from a locally bad rule choice that would send
                  depth-first search down a long blind alley;
     SLOW_TAC     backtracks over more alternatives than FAST_TAC
                  (including how assumptions pair with rules), trading
                  time for coverage;
     ASTAR_TAC    best-first, weighting goal size against proof depth;
     DEEPEN_TAC   complete for its rule set: searches to depth 1, 2,
                  ... so it cannot diverge down an infinite branch.

   SLOW_BEST_TAC and SLOW_ASTAR_TAC are BEST_TAC and ASTAR_TAC run
   with SLOW_TAC's wider step, and FIRST_BEST_TAC is BEST_TAC free to
   expand whichever subgoal a rule applies to rather than always the
   leftmost -- the right choice when the leftmost subgoal is the one
   that needs a witness the others would have supplied.

(* Pelletier problem 18: the witness has to serve for every [x], so a
   depth-first searcher that commits to the first candidate never
   recovers; iterative deepening finds the two-step proof. *)

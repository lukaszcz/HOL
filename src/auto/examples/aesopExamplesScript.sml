   Examples: best-first proof search (aesopLib)

   AESOP_TAC is a best-first search engine in the style of Lean's
   Aesop: it treats claset rules, normalisation and the simplifier as
   moves in a single prioritised search tree.  Each expansion
   normalises the goal, applies safe rules to saturation, and then
   branches on unsafe rules ordered by their declared success
   probability.

     AESOP_TAC ths        close the goal or fail
     AESOP_SAFE_TAC ths   normalisation and safe rules only; keeps
                          progress and leaves the residue

   Both use the ambient claset and simpset and accept the same
   [thm list] as the clasimp tactics: facts, claset markers (Intro,
   Dest, Forward, ...), Simp/Iff markers and simplifier controls.

   The CS_ variants take an explicit aesop_config, claset and simpset;
   augment_aesop and augment_aesop_rule add session-local rules with
   custom tactics -- see aesopLib.sig.

   This theory imports clasetExamplesTheory, so the [sintro]/[dest]/
   [forward] declarations made there for [subp] and [inhab] are in
   force here -- persistence of declarations across the theory
   hierarchy is itself part of the design.

   and is reached by the seeded EL_CONS, which takes a cons at an index
   known only to be non-zero, as the successor in the goal is.  The two
   [LIST_REL_NIL] readings, [list_L3014_list_all2_Nil] and
   [list_L3017_list_all2_Nil2], are reached once the seeded one-sided
   nil equations for ZIP empty the [set (zip xs ys)] the cited
   [list_all2_iff] expands to.  [list_L7775_in_measures_2] withholds
   one conjunct of the ambient [in_measures] and is reached by the
   citation it names: [measures] is now defined as the source defines
   it, and unfolding it leaves a pair of conses in the equal-length
   lexicographic order the ambient [Cons_in_lex] takes apart.
   [list_L7300_Nil_lenlex_iff2] no longer meets [SHORTLEX_NIL2] at
   all: [lenlex] is now the source's composite too, and unfolding it
   leaves the nil in the equal-length order the ambient
   [Nil2_notin_lex] rejects.

   Two more have left it, and these two because the second route now
   exists.  [list_L8187_list_all_Cons_iff] and
   [list_L8195_list_ex_Cons_iff] withhold one conjunct of [EVERY_DEF]
   and of [EXISTS_DEF], and what the cited [list_all_iff] /
   [list_ex_iff] leave is a bounded quantifier over a cons.  Isabelle
   reads [set (x # xs)] as an insert, so the insert clauses of
   [ball_simps] and [bex_simps], both simp there, split the head off
   above the membership; HOL4 spells the membership as MEM, whose own
   cons equation is simp too, and outermost-first the quantifier
   descends into that instead.  The seeded list reading of those
   clauses is stated on the quantifier, so it is reached first. *)

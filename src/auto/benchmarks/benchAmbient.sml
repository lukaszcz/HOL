   [source_lexordp], [source_lexordp_eq] and [source_upto] never appear
   there.  The theory read is the check rather than the construction --
   the selftest requires every definition it records to have a mined
   row -- and a row naming nothing raises here, at load. *)

(* The one lemma in the ambient set.  Isabelle's [sorted] *is*
   [sorted_wrt (<=)], so every fact its simpset carries about a sorted
   list -- [sorted_upt] and the rest -- applies to the [sorted_wrt]
   reading without anyone naming it.  HOL4 states those facts about its
   own adjacent SORTED, and the translation's [source_sorted] unfolds
   to [source_sorted_wrt], whose definition takes a nil or a cons apart
   and says nothing about a list variable; without the correspondence
   the predicate is opaque and the ambient facts cannot reach it.  The
   bridge is conditional on transitivity, which is what the source
   linorder supplies, so it hands a goal nothing that Isabelle's
   [sorted] did not already have. *)

(* Results Isabelle declares simp about a constant the translation
   carries.  Its ambient context is its simpset and so has them; ours
   is the translation's definitions, so a method whose simp step leans
   on one reaches a residual that is the declared result itself, stated
   and out of reach.  Every entry cites the declaration it transplants.
   An entry may be a corpus goal's statement -- two Isabelle facts can
   translate onto one HOL4 theorem, and [map_add_find_right] is
   map_L887 once [map_le] is unfolded -- and the measurement then
   withholds it on that one goal, exactly as it withholds a citation
   that states its goal.  The list is the source's own ambient context
   and never a goal's answer.

   src/HOL/List.thy @ f7e02b7e declares [fold_append] simp, and
   List.thy:3424 [foldl_append] is reached through it.  The same file
   declares [takeWhile_append1] and [takeWhile_append2] simp, which is
   how a source proof that pushes a takeWhile across an append never
   names them: List.thy:2545 [takeWhile_append] states the two together
   and still cites them, and List.thy:4637 [extract_Some_iff] reaches
   one after unfolding [extract].

   Relation.thy:1572 declares [Image_singleton_iff] [iff]: the simpset
   takes a relational image of a singleton apart, though [Image] itself
   is a plain definition and stays folded.  String.thy:64 [char_of_char]
   and String.thy:91 [of_char_of] are the roundtrip pair Isabelle
   declares simp about [char_of], whose own definition it withholds;
   neither line was mined into the corpus, so transplanting them hands
   no goal its own statement.

   List.thy:2789 declares [nth_zip] simp, which is how a source proof
   that indexes into a zip never names it; HOL4's [EL_ZIP] asks for
   equal lengths instead of the two bounds the truncating ZIP needs,
   so the translation states Isabelle's form.

   List.thy:3788 declares [distinct_upt] simp, List.thy:3478
   [take_upt] and List.thy:3485 [drop_upt], which is how a source proof
   that asks whether an interval repeats, or cuts one at a length,
   never names them.  HOL4's list library answers the first with an
   injectivity condition and carries neither of the other two, so the
   three transplants below are what its interval vocabulary lacks
   against Isabelle's.

   Map.thy:91-92 states [map_of]'s clauses as equations between
   functions, and Map.thy declares [map_add_empty] (:346),
   [map_add_upd] (:369) and [map_of_append] (:378) simp.  That is the
   whole context a source proof about a list update runs in: it splits
   the association list at the append, reads the last pair as an
   update, and drops the empty map, naming none of them.  HOL4's
   recursion takes the key as well, so the translation's own clauses
   are the pointwise reading and the unapplied map the three rewrites
   need is never exposed; the two clauses are restated here in the
   source's form.

   Map.thy declares [map_add_find_right], [map_add_assoc],
   [map_le_refl] and [map_le_map_add] simp and [map_add_None] iff,
   about [map_add] and [map_le], whose definitions it withholds: a
   method that never names [map_add_def] still reads a value out of the
   right-hand map, reassociates two of them, and settles the order
   between a map and a sum it is part of.

   Fun.thy declares [fun_upd_apply] (:872) and [fun_upd_upd] (:883)
   simp and [fun_upd_triv] (:869) iff, about [fun_upd], whose
   definition it withholds.  They are what a source proof about an
   update runs on: the first takes the constant apart wherever the
   proof reaches a point, and the other two are the only two shapes
   Isabelle collapses without one.

   List.thy introduces [lists] as an inductive set (:6857) and leaves
   its definition folded, declaring instead [lists.Nil] (:6861) and
   [lists_Int_eq] (:6890), [lists_empty] (:6922) and [lists_UNIV]
   (:6925) simp.  Reading the definition as ambient instead -- which is
   what a set whose introduction rules carry simp otherwise means -- is
   generous in one direction and disarming in the other: Isabelle's simp
   takes a nil or a cons apart and never touches a [lists] at a list
   variable, while unfolding the definition rewrites every occurrence
   and leaves the classical rules below, all stated about the constant,
   matching nothing.  [list_L6972] is the goal that separates them --
   [lists A SUBSET lists B] from [A SUBSET B] is settled by the three
   declarations and not by any rewrite. *)

(* An alias definition is ambient, so by the time one of the lemmas

   is gone and ORD stands where it was.  A lemma still stated on the

   reading of Isabelle's [of_char_of], and the residual it has to close
   spells the same term with ORD.  Reading the lemmas through the

(* The claset half.  Isabelle declares these about a constant whose
   definition it withholds, with a classical attribute rather than
   [simp], and its [blast], [safe], [clarify], [auto] and [force] read
   them without naming them.  A rewrite cannot stand in for one: the
   rules above match a map sum under [= NONE] or build one from a
   value, and none of them takes a sum apart under [= SOME x], which is
   the residual Isabelle's [dest!] rule closes.  As with the rewrites,
   a rule that states a corpus goal is withheld on that goal.

   An entry carries the class Isabelle gives it, [!] safe and plain
   unsafe, with the one exception below.  The two directions were
   measured and they disagree, so neither reading can be applied
   blanket.  A safe elimination whose major premise is entirely
   schematic is applied at every tableau node, so it meets the
   undetermined literals a witness-guessing branch leaves behind: the
   seed clasets measured [set_L1610_Pow_Compl] at 88 tableau branches
   with such a rule unsafe and 3638 and past budget with it [sdest]
   (measured 2026-09-09; that goal has since become a shortfall of its
   own, over budget in either class, so the contrast is the record of
   what the class cost and not a goal to re-run for it), and
   [map_add_SomeD] is that shape.  It costs nothing there --
   [map_L611] closes in 0.107s safe and 0.100s unsafe -- so it is
   carried unsafe against its [dest!].  The Sigma rules run the other
   way: safe, they close [split_paired_Ball_Sigma], its [Bex] twin,
   [Times_subset_cancel2] and [SigmaE]; unsafe, the same rules did not
   return in twenty minutes on the first of those.  Their major
   premise names the constant, so a tableau node meets them only where
   a Sigma is on the branch. *)

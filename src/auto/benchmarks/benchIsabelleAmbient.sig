(* Why each constant the translation defines is, or is not, in the
   ambient set: the command Isabelle introduces it with, mined from the
   Isabelle2025-2 sources, where the constant is Isabelle's; the
   translation's own reason for naming it, where it is not. *)

      Fun
    | Primrec
      (* A datatype selector or predicator: the package declares those
         equations simp too. *)
    | Datatype
      (* A constant Isabelle's simpset reduces without being told,
         though the introducing command declared nothing: a separately
         declared characterisation ([sort_key_simps], [atLeast_iff]), or
         an inductive set whose introduction rules carry [simp]. *)
    | Simp
      (* The translation names a term Isabelle writes inline -- an
         [abbreviation] among them -- so an Isabelle goal never contains
         the constant at all, and the equation restores the term the
         source proof worked on. *)
    | Notation
      (* The translation's own encoding of a source type HOL4 states
         differently.  Unfolding it is reading the representation, not a
         source definition. *)
    | Representation
      (* The constant renames one HOL4 already has, argument for
         argument.  The equation is the bridge between two vocabularies
         rather than a source definition, and the facts an Isabelle
         method reads about the source constant answer to HOL4's.  This
         is why a plain [definition] is nonetheless supplied; where
         Isabelle's own command already makes the constant ambient, that
         command is recorded instead, being the more particular fact. *)
    | Alias
      (* Declares no simp equation: Isabelle's simpset leaves the
         constant folded. *)
    | Definition
      (* Declares its equations simp, as [fun] does, from the point a
         [termination] block proves its termination. *)
    | Function
      (* A [function] whose equations the source then takes back out of
         its simpset. *)
    | SimpDeleted
      (* Isabelle carries the source's equations and the translation
         states the constant by a characterisation the source declares
         nowhere, so the two sides share no equation: supplying this one
         would hand a goal what the source did not have. *)
    | Characterisation
      (* A datatype constructor whose type carries no ambient selector
         equations: opaque to Isabelle's simpset, so the translation's
         defining equation goes beyond what the source has.  A
         constructor of a type HOL4 states differently is Representation
         instead -- there the selector equations Isabelle's simpset does
         carry have no HOL4 counterpart but the encoding. *)

     those of them that precede it in the import graph. *)

     the line order; across two it is the import order.  Raises on a

(* A statement is unchanged when a conjunction or a disjunction is

   the goal under those three symmetries is the goal, and comparing
   the two terms as written misses it: a translation lemma whose
   conjuncts happen to stand in the other order would close its own
   goal with nothing to report.

   The quotient is by symmetries only, so two terms with the same
   normal form do state the same thing.  It is incomplete in the other
   direction: the renaming is read off the term before the reordering,
   so two statements whose free variables first occur in different

(* A citation and a goal can be one statement written two ways: the
   quantifier prefix differs, the premises stand in a different order,
   or the citation states the goal alongside other conjuncts.
   Stripping only the citation and comparing what is left against the
   whole goal therefore sees a citation that is a premise-free goal and
   misses one that is a goal carrying premises.

   So the citation is read every way a rule is read from it -- prefix
   off, premises accumulated, conjunction split, since a conjunctive
   rule enters the simpset as one rewrite per conjunct -- and it is the
   goal when one of those readings has the goal's conclusion and every
   premise it carries is one the goal carries too.  Coverage runs that
   way only: a reading with fewer premises is stronger than the goal and
   supplies it outright, while one with a premise the goal does not have
   leaves work and is not the goal.

   A prefix is not always one prefix.  A rule can quantify what its
   premise speaks about, discharge it, and quantify again over what is
   left -- [!x s. x NOTIN s ==> !t. s SUBSET x INSERT t <=> s SUBSET t]
   -- and taking the prefix off once leaves the inner one standing in
   the conclusion, where it is nothing the goal says.  Such a rule was
   read as no reading of the goal at all, and two goals that are one of
   these rules were measured with their own statement left in the
   simpset.  So a reading with premises is read on beyond them, for as
   often as a prefix reappears.  The readings that stop there are kept
   beside the ones that go on, because a conclusion that is the whole
   goal is a reading of it in its own right and reading past its prefix
   loses it.  Moving a prefix out past a premise is an equivalence, so
   this adds readings without admitting any statement the rule does not
   make. *)

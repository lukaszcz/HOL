(* Both tables are keyed by the "Thy$Name" form, so a retraction spelled
   with a dot has to be normalized before it can delete anything.  Each
   table is therefore retracted once in each spelling: the inherited
   declaration in one form and the sibling branch's declaration -- which
   is not in this theory's ancestry at all -- in the other. *)

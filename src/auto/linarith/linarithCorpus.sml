(* The core goals themselves, in source order.  They are stated here
   rather than in either suite because both run them: the suite in this
   directory runs exactly these, and the instances suite merges them
   with the 20 that need int, real or rat syntax.  Those 20 are the
   whole of what the pre-boss grammar cannot state, so they are the
   whole of what the split has to duplicate; a goal stated in both files
   instead is one whose two statements can drift apart while both suites
   still pass, because what check_numbering checks is the numbers.

   Both upstream "oops" goals are retained: [47] is proved, because
   splitting on demand never builds the disjunctive normal form whose
   size defeated upstream, and [48] is the corpus's one method boundary
   -- linear arithmetic's documented integer-divisibility incompleteness
   -- asserted to be reported, promptly and by that name, rather than
   run into. *)

  (* negated says the relation appeared under a negation, and only the
     order relations ever carry it: linarithDecomp.decomp turns a
     negated equality into REL_NEQ with negated = false, and REL_NEQ has
     no negated form because ~(x <> y) is not a relation this layer
     recognises.  So a producer of a decomp -- decomp, less_decomp,
     swap_less, or a caller building one directly -- must present an
     equation as REL_EQ and a disequation as REL_NEQ, both unnegated.
     Row building reads the invariant rather than restating both
     encodings. *)

(* Test support shared by the suites that exercise linear arithmetic,
   and not part of linarithLib's surface.  Two of them are the
   Arith_Examples strength corpora: selftest.sml here runs the 34
   num/bool goals; instances/selftest.sml runs all 54 translations.
   Those 34 goals are stated here, along with the driver and the
   canonical numbering both suites are checked against, so that the one
   proposition each stands for is written once.  What cannot be shared
   is the other 20: this directory is pre-boss and cannot parse int,
   real or rat syntax, so the instances suite states those itself and
   merges them into the numbering.  The assertion helpers below are
   shared more widely still: clasimp's and aesop's suites reach linear
   arithmetic through their solvers and check the same [arith] table. *)

  (* A corpus goal is either one the tactics are expected to close, or
     one they are expected to refuse.  Refusal is asserted only where
     refusing is the specified behaviour: a method boundary, a goal
     linear arithmetic is documented not to decide.  A goal that is
     merely hard, or slow, does not belong in the second category --
     failing it is not desired behaviour, and a suite that asserts the
     failure obstructs the work of removing it, and cannot tell a
     reported "no proof" from a tactic that never came back.

     Both fields of a boundary are checked.  error is the message the
     tactic must fail with, so that a goal recorded as beyond the method
     cannot be silently satisfied by an unrelated crash; the boundary
     budget is much tighter than the goal budget, so that a boundary is
     one the tactics report rather than one they run into.  remedy names
     the decision procedure that would close the goal, and is what the
     suite prints when the boundary moves. *)

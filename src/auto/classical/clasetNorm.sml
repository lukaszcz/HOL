(* [IN] is a boolTheory constant, [IN = \x f. f x], so [x IN P] and [P x]
   are one proposition written two ways, and a search that reads them as
   two atoms cannot get from one to the other.  Membership is the normal
   form because it is the one a search can hold on to: a set inside
   [x IN A] stays inside it however [A] is instantiated, whereas [A x]
   with [A] instantiated to a set former is an atom no rule about that
   former can match.

   The crossing is made at formula positions only.  Term positions keep
   beta-eta, so [\x. f x] still contracts to [f]; and a body wrapped as
   [x IN P] is no longer an eta redex, which is what stops [!x. P x] from
   collapsing to [$! P] and coming back applied when a search instantiates
   it.  A formula position is one the engines themselves decompose; an
   atom is compared whole, so a formula buried in a term position needs no
   crossing. *)

(* [is_hole] tells the crossing which variables stand for an unknown rather
   than for a set.  [?P x] is how a search asks pattern unification to build
   a predicate, and writing it as a membership would leave a first-order
   problem that only another membership can solve.  Each engine names its own
   holes: the classical engine's metavariables, blast's rule variables.

   [total] decides how much of an application counts as a set.  The crossing
   proper answers only where the spelling is forced -- an application of a
   variable -- and leaves a compound head alone, because a rule may be
   stated either way over one and canonicalising would lose the other.  A
   total crossing answers everywhere, and is a spelling rather than a normal
   form for exactly that reason: it exists so a lookup can ask for the
   membership form of a goal the way [applied_conv] asks for the applied
   one. *)

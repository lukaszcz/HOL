(* A rewrite whose condition carries a variable its left-hand side does
   not determine reaches the traversal with that variable existentially
   closed: [QUANTIFY_CONDITIONS] is what HOL4 has where Isabelle leaves
   a schematic in the condition.  [EVERY2_LENGTH] is the shape --
   [LIST_REL P l1 l2 ==> LENGTH l1 = LENGTH l2] prepares to
   [(?P. LIST_REL P l1 l2) ==> (LENGTH l1 = LENGTH l2 <=> T)] -- and
   Isabelle discharges the condition of its own [list_all2_lengthD] by
   assumption, the unifier reading the relation off the assumption the
   schematic meets.  The existential is what is left of that unification
   here, and nothing above answers it: the assumption is in the context,
   and the condition asks for the witness the assumption names.

   So this pass names it: the condition is matched against the context
   assumptions with the goal's own variables held fixed, and the
   witnesses the match reads off discharge the existential.  A rewrite
   with more than one premise arrives as one existential over their
   conjunction, so the conjuncts are matched in turn under what the
   earlier ones have named.  A match against an assumption already in
   the context is Isabelle's [assume_tac] step, not a search.

   It is the subgoaler, not a solver, because the subgoaler is the one
   slot only a side condition reaches: the traversal simplifies a
   condition through it and offers what survives to the solvers, while
   the solvers are also what a simplification tactic tries on the goal
   itself.  An existential goal is not a condition a rewrite left open,
   and simplification does not prove one in Isabelle either.  The
   subgoaler runs the traversal's own recursion first and looks only at
   what that leaves. *)

(* HOL4's COND_CONG simplifies both branches of a conditional as well as
   its condition.  A recursive equation whose right-hand side is a
   conditional -- how an interval or an iteration is ordinarily stated --
   then rewrites its own unfolding without end: the branch holds an
   instance of the rule's own left-hand side, and rewriting it produces
   another.  Isabelle states such equations and rewrites with them, which
   its weak conditional congruence -- the condition simplified, the
   branches left alone -- is what allows.  Nothing short of that helps:
   the unfolding is licensed by the rule alone, so a congruence that
   descends into the branches at all diverges, whether or not it carries
   the condition down with it.  This layer follows Isabelle; the branch
   reasoning comes back from the case split, split_ss below.

   A congruence belongs to a fragment and a fragment is replaced whole,
   so the three other congruences of CONG_ss are restated here. *)

(* src/HOL/Set.thy:461,471 @ f7e02b7e.  [ball_cong_simp] and
   [bex_cong_simp] are default congruences there, so the body of a
   bounded quantifier is simplified with its bound in context.  HOL4
   spells a bounded quantifier unfolded -- [EXISTS_MEM] states
   [EXISTS P l] as [?e. MEM e l /\ P e], [IN_IMAGE] leaves the
   membership on the other side of the conjunction -- so the rule has to
   be stated of the conjunction the quantifier binds, once per
   membership and once per side.  Neither side subsumes the other: with
   the membership on the left the body is what its bound simplifies, and
   with the membership on the right the body is the context the
   membership simplifies in, which is where an assumption constraining
   the elements that answer an equation gets to fire.

   What it must not be stated of is every conjunction, which is
   Isabelle's [conj_cong]: Isabelle declines to make that a default
   congruence and a measurement agrees, the four-square identity of the
   algebra corpus going from 0.9s to 483s against a 30s budget as the
   conjunctive side conditions of the ring rewrites each acquire a
   context.  Keeping the bound rigid is not a weakening towards that
   measurement but the source's own shape: a bounded quantifier is what
   Isabelle carries a congruence for.  It also keeps the rule away from
   an existential a *rewrite* is conditional on -- [submonoid_element]
   in src/algebra states [x IN H] under [?h. h << g /\ ...], whose
   conjuncts are not a bound on the variable -- where opening the body
   re-enables the rewrite that raised the condition and the search
   recurses to the conditional depth.

   The last premise is what keeps the rule from taking the conjunction
   away from everything else.  A congruence decides the descent at the
   node it matches, so without it the conjunction under the quantifier
   would never again be a term the rewrites and the caller's own
   congruences see -- a [Cong] argument stated of a conjunction stops
   working under an existential, and the bound itself stops being
   rewritten.  Handing the rebuilt conjunction back to the traversal
   restores both, at one further pass over a body that is already in
   normal form.

   The bounded universal needs nothing: it unfolds to an implication,
   which [IMP_CONG] below already opens. *)

(* Two spellings of one statement reach a rewrite as two terms.
   Isabelle never meets the difference -- its rule and its goal are
   stated in the same theory and already agree on the order of a
   conjunction and the side an equation is written on, so its
   simplifier needs no ordering step and carries none: [conj_ac],
   [disj_ac] and [eq_ac] are all stated in HOL.thy and none of them is
   [simp] there.  A translated goal does meet it, because the HOL4
   result answering the source's states the same fact in its own order,
   and what is left is an equivalence between a term and a permutation
   of itself.

   Ordering the goal instead is not open to this layer.  A conjunction
   carries its left conjuncts into the right one's context -- that is
   what [rev_conj_cong] is, and the corpus names it -- so reordering a
   conjunction takes away the context a conditional rewrite is
   discharged in; measured, an ambient AC fragment costs the
   translation theory's own proof of [source_set_zip].  So the
   permutation is *decided* rather than imposed: the two sides are
   ordered privately, and if they agree the equivalence is closed.  The

     [\offset. start + offset] as well.  HOL4's rewriter matches up to
     alpha and beta only, so without this the two silently fail to meet;
     a translated term arrives in both spellings, since the translation
     writes the abstraction and the simplifier contracts it only
     sometimes.  The classical search does close some such goals on its

  (* The same mismatch one spelling further on.  Isabelle normalises the
     natural number 1 to [Suc 0] -- One_nat_def is a simp rule there --
     so a fact stated on SUC fires against a goal that bounds by a
     numeral.  HOL4 normalises the other way, numerals being the normal
     form, and a cited SUC rule then never meets the goal.  SUC_FILTER
     closes the gap from HOL4's side, deriving the numeral-matching
     variant of each SUC rule as it enters, which leaves HOL4's normal
     form alone. *)

  (* The same mismatch again, and this one HOL4's normal form cannot be
     left alone through.  Isabelle's [append_assoc] is a simp rule that
     reads into the right-nested form and its [append_Cons] keeps a cons
     at the front, so every source result about a walk down [xs @ ys] is
     stated of a right-nested append.  HOL4 exports [APPEND_ASSOC] as a
     rewrite in the other direction and [listSimps]' equation
     normalisation turns a trailing cons into a singleton append, so the
     same term arrives as [(xs ++ [y]) ++ zs]; a rule about the prefix
     every element satisfies then has to read [xs ++ [y]] as that
     prefix, which is false of [y], and it never fires.  The two
     directions cannot both be ambient -- each is the other's reverse
     and the pair loops -- and the layer needs neither: dropping HOL4's
     leaves an append with the nesting it was written with, which for a
     translated goal is the source's.  The cons clause of APPEND is simp
     on both sides and keeps a leading cons at the front.  The equation
     procedure the exclusion drops comes back respelled: cancelling is
     wanted, its normal form is not. *)

     conjunction or existential reaches a source rule as an implication;
     HOL4 stops at the disjunction its own de Morgan rules leave.  The
     difference is not cosmetic: the simplifier's condition solver
     discharges a conditional rewrite's side condition from
     [!item. MEM item prefix ==> ~predicate item] and not from
     [!item. ~MEM item prefix \/ ~predicate item], so a rule whose
     condition constrains the elements of a list stops firing at exactly
     the goals that state the constraint negatively.  Isabelle declares
     this direction only -- [disj_not2] is left out there for changing
     the orientation -- and HOL4 carries no rewrite the other way, so
     the pair cannot loop. *)

     reads such a chain off the linorder class without naming it
     (Provers/order_tac.ML, installed by Orderings.thy).  The decision
     procedure covers both places a chain is wanted, since it is asked
     about an atom wherever the traversal meets one: the atom the
     rewriting has left standing, and the side condition of a conditional
     rewrite, which is simplified with this same simpset. *)

     the first says what the solver below is left with once they are
     there: the arithmetic solver "is really only useful to detect
     inconsistencies among the premises for subgoals which are not
     themselves (in)equalities, because the latter activate
     fast_nat_arith_simproc anyway".  The layer carried only that half,
     so an unfolded interval left a linear fact about num -- an atom in

     [LENGTH l - (n + 1)] -- and the reducer above only decides.  So two
     spellings of one term never met here: this simpset folds the
     repeated subtraction to [LENGTH l - (1 + n)] and leaves it beside
     [LENGTH l - (n + 1)].  [ARITH_AC_ss] is that normalisation on its

(* Isabelle reads an ordered rewrite by its schematic variables.  Stated
   with them a rule is permutative, and the simplifier applies it only in
   the direction its term order takes downwards; the same rule
   instantiated at the goal's own fixed terms has no schematic variable
   left, is not permutative, and rewrites left to right.  That is how
   [force] closes a goal whose supplied fact commutes an operation: its
   search instantiates the fact at the goal's terms, and the simplifier
   it runs before each unsafe step reads the instance as an ordinary
   rewrite.

   HOL4 has no Free/Var distinction in a term, but it has one in a
   theorem: a variable free in a theorem's hypotheses is a local constant
   to matching, which is what [HO_PART_MATCH] computes its [lconsts]
   from.  So an instance is made rigid the way Isabelle's search makes
   one: the rule's conditions are discharged from the goal's own
   assumptions, and the terms those assumptions speak of can no longer be
   matched away.  A rule with nothing to discharge yields nothing here,
   which is right -- Isabelle refuses an uninstantiated permutative rule
   just as HOL4 does, and the parity gap is only about the instance a
   condition pins down.

   What the ordering guard sees is still a permutation, so the instance
   goes in *bounded*, which is that guard's own escape: bounded once per
   occurrence of the redex, since the rewrite removes the left-hand side
   it fires on and nothing else can reach it.  Every hypothesis of an
   instance is one of the goal's assumptions, so a proof that uses it
   still answers the goal it was read from. *)

(* [not_None_eq] reads an arbitrary option through a constructor: the
   subject of its left side [x <> NONE] is a pattern variable, so the rule
   is about every term of the type.  Isabelle declares it [iff] and its
   simplifier rewrites the innermost redex first, so the rule is only ever
   offered a subject already in normal form.  HOL4's rewrites the outermost
   redex first, so a rule of that shape fires above every rule about the
   subject's own head, and its right side re-embeds the subject where none
   of them match: [(m ++ n) x <> NONE] becomes the stuck
   [?y. (m ++ n) x = SOME y], where Isabelle rewrites the inner [= NONE] by
   [map_add_None] and reaches the disjunction that discharges it.

   A low-priority reducer is what the traversal reaches only once the
   rewrites and the descent have both left a node alone, which is the order
   Isabelle applies such a rule in: on the term above it now yields
   [n x = NONE ==> ?y. m x = SOME y], and on a subject that is a variable
   it yields what the rewrite did.  So the declaration differs from [iff]
   in where its simpset half goes and nowhere else -- the claset halves are
   the same derived rules, under the same names.

   The rewrite is not a named simpset entry, so [delsimps] does not address
   it; [remove_iff_bottom_up] retracts a declaration, as [remove_iff] does
   for [iff]. *)

(* A conditional rule whose conclusion is an equation between variables --

   [Simplifier.mksimps] keeps the schematic left-hand side, and the
   subgoaler instantiates the schematics its conditions carry by unifying
   them against the assumptions.  HOL4 matches the left-hand side first and
   only then proves the conditions, so a left-hand side that is a bare
   variable is refused and the rule is turned into an [<=> T] rewrite of
   its own conclusion, with the condition variables the conclusion does not
   carry existentially closed
   (IMP_EQ_CANON and QUANTIFY_CONDITIONS, src/simp/src/Cond_rewr.sml).
   [inj_onD] prepares to
   [(?f s t. INJ f s t /\ x IN s /\ y IN s /\ f x = f y) ==> (x = y <=> T)]:
   a rewrite whose pattern is an equation between two variables, so it
   matches every equation in the goal, and whose condition the match
   determines nothing of.  It cannot fire, and it is not merely inert: the
   simplifier reaches it at every equation and calls its solver on the
   existential, so a four-assumption goal does not come back in a minute
   where the same call without the argument returns at once.

   The rule reaches those goals as an unsafe destruction rule instead: its
   premises say where the condition variables come from, so the reasoner
   fires it on an assumption matching the first and resolves the rest --
   what Isabelle's subgoaler does when it instantiates the schematics a
   condition carries, and the declaration Isabelle's own libraries give
   this rule family ([dest: inj_onD]).  Conclusion-directed instead, as an
   introduction rule, it is offered on every equality goal with the
   witnesses its premises name left to the search to guess: measured on the
   corpus goal that names [inj_onD], the destruction rule closes it and the
   introduction rule does not close it in twelve times the time.

   The test is on that exact shape, and reads the argument's form rather
   than its name.  A conditional equation between variables whose conditions
   the two sides do determine -- [LIST_EQ] is one -- carries no existential
   and keeps its rewrite, and so does an argument that prepares to several
   rewrites of which any is usable. *)

   that test, and it is what keeps every other rewrite that happens to
   match the goal's statement out of the decision -- and the step
   stands down for one that takes this equation where it stands.
   Taken first, the default puts the equation out of that rewrite's
   reach for good -- a membership at a constant-headed side that is a

   leaves goals in.  Each fact enters in every spelling -- the same

(* Isabelle's first-order step lambda-lifts before it searches: an
   abstraction standing in an argument position becomes a constant with
   a defining equation, so a fact whose function variable has to take
   that abstraction as its value is instantiated first-order and the
   result is used without a beta step.  HOL4's clausifier carries the
   same transformation (normalForms.extract_lambdas) but does not run
   it, so the instantiation leaves a redex the search cannot reduce and
   the step is not taken.

   An abstraction argument of a constant of theory bool or min is the
   body of a binder rather than data, and is descended into instead;
   an eta-contractible one already names a function; and one mentioning
   a variable an enclosing binder binds cannot be named by a goal-level
   variable.  Naming happens whenever there is anything to name, as it
   does in Isabelle: the defining equation goes into the goal with the
   name, so the search is given back everything the abstraction said. *)
